# GitPad.exe - Use Notepad as your Git commit editor

This single executable allows you to use Notepad as your editor any time Git
requires one (commits, interactive rebase, etc).

## How to install

Just copy GitPad.exe to a folder and double-click on it. It will install
itself into your Application Data directory (%AppData%) - if your default
editor is not set, GitPad.exe will set itself to EDITOR via setting an
Environment Variable on your user profile.
